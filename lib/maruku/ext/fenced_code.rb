# Fenced code blocks begin with three or more tildes and are terminated
# by a closing line with at least as many tildes as the opening line.
# Optionally, an attribute list may appear at the end of the opening
# line.  For example:
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {: lang=ruby }
# puts 'Hello world'
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
